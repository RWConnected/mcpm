# MCPM â€” Minecraft Package Manager

**MCPM** is a cross-platform **package manager for Minecraft** mods, written in **Rust** with a future **Tauri + Vue.js** GUI.  
It automates downloading, updating, and managing Minecraft mods â€” like `npm` or `cargo`, but for Minecraft.

> Hobby project in active development. Expect breaking changes.

## Quick Start

You can use MCPM without building it yourself.

### Option 1 â€” Download a Prebuilt Binary
Head to the [**Releases page**](../../releases) and download the latest binary for your platform.

### Option 2 â€” Use Docker

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/RWConnected/mcpm:latest

# Run MCPM in a container (mount your modpack folder)
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data ghcr.io/RWConnected/mcpm:latest mcpm init
```

Both binaries and Docker images include the CLI by default.

### Option 3 â€” Building from Source

If you want to install MCPM on your system without using a prebuilt binary or Docker, you can build it directly from source using Cargo.

#### Prerequisites
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)

#### Build and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RWConnected/mcpm.git
cd mcpm
cargo install --path src-tauri
```

This will:
- Compile MCPM in release mode
- Install the binaries (mcpm and mcpm-cli) into ~/.cargo/bin
- Make them available globally (ensure ~/.cargo/bin is in your PATH)

You can then run:

```bash
mcpm-cli --help
```

## Contributing

MCPM is a personal hobby project.
Ideas, bug reports, and pull requests are very welcome â€” they help shape the tool and inspire new directions.

That said, please note:
- This is not my main focus, so reviews or responses may take time.
- Contributions might be declined if they donâ€™t align with the projectâ€™s direction or goals.
- To avoid wasted effort, itâ€™s best to open an issue first to discuss major ideas before starting work.

Even if a contribution isnâ€™t merged, your input is still appreciated â€” it helps improve MCPM over time.

### Prerequisites
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
- Optionally: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for the Vue.JS frontend (Not yet implemented)

### Build and Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RWConnected/mcpm.git
cd mcpm/src-tauri
cargo run --bin mcpm-cli -- <command> [options]
```

Example:
```bash
cargo run --bin mcpm-cli -- add sodium --search
```
