# MCPM ‚Äî Minecraft Package Manager

**MCPM** is a cross-platform **package manager for Minecraft** mods, written in **Rust**.
It automates downloading, updating, and managing Minecraft mods ‚Äî like `npm` or `cargo`, but for Minecraft.
It is CLI-first but I'm planning a future release with an optional **Tauri + Vue.js** GUI.  

> Hobby project in active development. Expect breaking changes.

## Features

- **CLI-first** tool built with [Clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap)
- **Mod management** via Modrinth API  
  - `mcpm add` ‚Äî add a mod to your manifest  
  - `mcpm remove` ‚Äî remove a mod  
  - `mcpm install` ‚Äî install or update all mods  
  - `mcpm upgrade` ‚Äî upgrade mods to newer compatible versions  
  - `mcpm outdated` ‚Äî check which mods are outdated  
  - `mcpm search` ‚Äî find mods interactively
- **Lockfile system** (`mcpm.lock`) for reproducible installs
- **Semantic versioning** support (`^1.2`, `>=1.20`, etc.)
- **Offline caching** of downloaded mods
- **Cross-platform** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Planned:**  
  - More sources like Curseforge, Github, Gitlab
  - Resource pack management  
  - Datapack management  
  - Shader and texture pack support  
  - Graphical interface via Tauri (Vue.js frontend)
  - Test suite (eventually‚Ä¶ I promise)

## Quick Start

You can use MCPM without building it yourself.

> The distributed executables are not code-signed and will show an ‚ÄúUnknown Publisher / Unidentified Developer‚Äù warning from the OS. This is expected, see [Bypassing OS warnings](#bypassing-os-warnings). You can verify any download before running. See [Verify Downloads](#verify-downloads) for verification steps.

### Option 1 ‚Äî Download a Prebuilt Binary
Head to the [**Releases page**](../../releases) and download the latest binary for your platform.

### Option 2 ‚Äî Use Docker

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/RWConnected/mcpm:latest

# Run MCPM in a container (mount your modpack folder)
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/data ghcr.io/RWConnected/mcpm:latest mcpm init
```

Both binaries and Docker images include the CLI by default.

### Option 3 ‚Äî Building from Source

If you want to install MCPM on your system without using a prebuilt binary or Docker, you can build it directly from source using Cargo.

#### Prerequisites
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)

#### Build and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RWConnected/mcpm.git
cd mcpm
cargo install --path src-tauri
```

This will:
- Compile MCPM in release mode
- Install the binaries (mcpm and mcpm-cli) into ~/.cargo/bin
- Make them available globally (ensure ~/.cargo/bin is in your PATH)

You can then run:

```bash
mcpm-cli --help
```

## Contributing

MCPM is a personal hobby project.
Ideas, bug reports, and pull requests are very welcome ‚Äî they help shape the tool and inspire new directions.

That said, please note:
- This is not my main focus, so reviews or responses may take time.
- Contributions might be declined if they don‚Äôt align with the project‚Äôs direction or goals.
- To avoid wasted effort, it‚Äôs best to open an issue first to discuss major ideas before starting work.

Even if a contribution isn‚Äôt merged, your input is still appreciated ‚Äî it helps improve MCPM over time.

### Contributor Requirements
By submitting a contribution, you confirm that you have the right to do so and that any included third-party material is compatible with the Apache 2.0 license.
Please mention external sources explicitly in pull requests if reused.

### Prerequisites
- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
- Optionally: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for the Vue.JS frontend (Not yet implemented)

### Build and Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RWConnected/mcpm.git
cd mcpm/src-tauri
cargo run -- <command> [options]
```

Example:
```bash
cargo run -- add sodium --search
```

## Recommended IDE Setup

## Bypassing OS warnings

Before running the binary and following these instructions, make sure you trust the binaries first!
See [Verify Downloads](#verify-downloads) for verification steps.

### Windows (SmartScreen)

1. Run the executable as you normally would.
2. When ‚ÄúWindows protected your PC‚Äù appears:
  - Click More info
  - Click Run anyway

Alternatively, you could trust the binary through PowerShell:
```powershell
Unblock-File -Path .\mcpm.exe
```

### macOS (Gatekeeper)

1. Run the executable as you normally would.
2. If blocked as ‚Äúunidentified developer‚Äù:
  - Control-click the app ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Open again
  - Or allow it under System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Allow Anyway

Alternatively, you could trust the binary through CLI:
```zsh
xattr -cr /path/to/mcpm.app
sudo spctl --add /path/to/mcpm.app
```

## Verify Downloads

To ensure the binary is authentic and unmodified:

1. Download files

From the GitHub Releases page, download:
- The binary (mcpm-.zip or mcpm-.tar.gz)
- Its signature (.sig)
- The checksum file (.sha256)
- The public key (publickey.asc)

2. Verify checksum

Confirm the file was not corrupted.

**Windows:**
```shell
certutil -hashfile mcpm-*.zip SHA256
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```shell
shasum -a 256 mcpm-*.tar.gz
```

Compare the result to the contents of the .sha256 file.

3. Verify signature

Validate that Rickiewars signed the release.

```shell
gpg --import publickey.asc
gpg --verify mcpm-*.sig mcpm-*.tar.gz
```

If output includes ‚ÄúGood signature from "Rickiewars"‚Äù, verification succeeded
